## 4 Create your account

- Click the **Get started** button and follow the steps to create your account.
When you create your account, you actually create 2 parts:
  * The public address: this part is safe to share publicly to receive money for example.
  * The private key: this part is the one that allows you to sign transactions, or prove that you own that address, thatâ€™s what allows you to send money for instance. 
You should keep this secret part super safe and never share it with anyone.
  
- Once you've created your account, click the menu button then **Account**

- Copy your  **Public address (substrate format)** then send it to an admin in the discord server so that they send you some Wikas!

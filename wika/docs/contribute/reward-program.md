# Contributor Rewards Program

Wika Network rewards contributors by minting new tokens. 

Its genesis block only has 1000 Wikas in the accounts of the first couple of validating nodes, 
and all tokens will be minted according to the rewards program policies agreed upon by the community, 
and documented here.

This policy is currently discussed offchain and executed using multi-sig sudo account, 
but we will move to a purely decentralized process inchain as soon as it is developed and tested.

The reward amounts are "calibrated" using a price of US$ 0.02 per Wika. 
This assumption is extremely simplistic and derives from a basic rationale: 1 million users, spending a average of $20 a year, 
divided by maximum supply of 1 billion Wikas.
In reality, it is extremely hard to predict the future market capitalization and price of the token at such an early stage of the project, 
so the assumption is just a basic way to calibrate our reward system.
